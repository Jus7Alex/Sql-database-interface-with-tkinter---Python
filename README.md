Submit, delete, search in database

This very simple program allows you to modify information in a small database, giving you a glimpse of how things work. 

First you have to populate your database by submitting students and their desired courses, after that you can have some fun with the options i created.

Just as a reminder if you wanna include the icon in the program remember to change it's path in the root.bitmap("").
